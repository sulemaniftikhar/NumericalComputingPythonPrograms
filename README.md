   - Solving numerically using:
     - **Euler's method**.
     - **Runge-Kutta (RK) method of order 4**.
   - Extracting, interpolating, and visualizing the data solutions.

3. **System of First-Order ODEs**  
   - Code implementation of the RK method (order 4) to solve a system of first-order ODEs.

4. **Second-Order ODE**  
   - Solution of a second-order ODE using the RK method (order 4).

### Part 2: Interpolation and System of Equations
1. **Data Interpolation**  
   - Perform cubic spline interpolation on the data provided in `bps.dat`.
   - Plot the interpolated results for visualization.

2. **Explicit Solution for a System of Equations**  
   - Derive analytical expressions for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) from a given system of equations.

3. **Population Estimation**  
   - Use **Newton's Backward Interpolation Formula** to estimate population growth for given census data.
